Imagine your design draft done half, or is going to run the code, suddenly, your computer relentless shut down! The The Wow, really can not think of life can have any worse things, and probably the rooftop met it. Mac after the period with, due to physical components (logic board, RAM, internal fan, etc.) failure, it is likely to lead to computer operating efficiency, running is not regular. At this time, your computer will be unable to open the file, search speed and accuracy decline, the application of abnormal circumstances. However, everything is beyond the way of the road drops, the following we will give you some maintenance programs to help you reduce the possibility of problems. Clever use of Apple Diagnostics to find hardware problems Monitor and maintain the health of the hard disk Use Apple Diagnostics to find hardware problemsMac’s hardware components are fairly robust. But over time, the failure may still occur, although the Mac may continue to run, but some failures can lead to hardware or software instability. Apple Diagnostics or earlier Apple Hardware Test is a comprehensive tool for determining hardware problems within Mac. This includes logic boards, memory, batteries or power adapters, sensors, graphics, and wireless components. It can be tested to ensure that all components and sensors are working properly. There are many ways to run Apple Diagnostics or Apple Hardware Test. Although their appearance and name are different, but they can test the hardware problem. This depends largely on its model and year. Since June 2013: Macs uses the new hardware test system Apple Diagnostics. It is a hidden disk image that can also run on the internet From mid-2011 to June 2013: Apple discontinued drive. Mac runs Apple Hardware Test in Recovery HD. If not available, they can run on the Internet By mid-2011: Mac with CD-ROM and OS X installation CD can not be made. Apple Diagnostics test programStep 1. If you have an Apple hardware test tool on a DVD or USB drive, insert it into your Mac. If the Mac does not contain external boot media, make sure the Mac is connected to the Internet. Step 2. Disconnect all external devices except the keyboard, mouse, monitor, Ethernet cable, and AC power. If you are testing on a laptop, make sure to connect to AC power. Also make sure the mouse and keyboard are connected to the computer via wired USB instead of Bluetooth. Step 3. Make sure the Mac is on a hard, flat, stable surface and well ventilated. Step 4. Select Apple menu&gt; Shutdown and wait for Mac to turn off completely. Step 5. Open Mac and then press and hold the D key on the keyboard immediately. Continue to hold the key until the Mac’s gray screen changes to a hardware test or Apple Diagnostics. Step 6. Hold down the Option-D key to force the system to load the tool from the Internet. Continue to hold the key until you see the “Start Internet Recovery” message on your Mac. Select the network from the drop-down menu and wait for the language interface to appear. If the hardware test or Apple Diagnostics starts successfully from the USB drive or Recovery HD, skip this step. Step 7. Select the language, then click the right arrow or press the Back key. Step 8. Click the Hardware Test tab. Apple hardware testing supports two types of tests - standard and extended testing. Click OK in the Perform Extension Test box, and then click the Test button. The latter test takes more time to finish. If the test goes smoothly, the test area will show no problems or pass Pass on all applicable tests. If the test is done smoothly, no problems are found or the issues are listed and the details are displayed. Step 9. During the testing process, you may hear the fan buzzing up and down, but this is part of the process. In the latest Mac, you will see a gray progress bar that shows Checking your Mac … roughly the rest of the time. Finally, click Restart to restart Mac. What if the hardware test can not be started?It is recommended that you turn off the computer, and then hold down the D key until a gray screen appears. If the gray screen fails, wait for the Mac to start, and then close and repeat the process. If you reinstall the old computer from scratch and unfortunately lose the original disk that came with the hardware test tool, the diagnostic tool may no longer be available. But you can save! You can also restore hardware testing tools. Use the following terminal commands to determine the model and board number of the Mac 1sysctl hw.model | awk '&#123; print $2 &#125;' ioreg -l | awk -F\\\" '/board-id/ &#123; print $4 &#125;' You need to jump to Apple Hardware Test Github Page and download your Mac related packages. Copy the package to the /System/Library/CoreServices/.diagnostics folder and then restart it while holding down the D to start the diagnostic tool. Explain the resultsWhen a test encounters any errors, a failure message appears as well as a reference code and a brief description. E.g NDK001,003,004 - Keyboard problems NDC001, 003 … to 006 - camera release NDR001,003,004 - with the touchpad PFM001, 0000 … to 007 - issued with SMC NDL001 problem with Bluetooth hardware If you encounter any hardware errors, you must move the Mac to the nearest Apple Store and replace it. Before you call Apple for support, please remember the error code and warranty card. You should run Apple Diagnostics Tests when the following conditions occur: Whenever you install new RAM or any new hardware components When you start to appear that can not resolve the disk utility or the problem of reinstalling the operating system When your Mac is used for more than three years longer Alternatives to the Apple Diagnostics toolThere are many third-party utilities that can perform specific types of hardware tests and provide you with more information. Memtest, found intermittent memory problems, which is a common cause of collapse or freezing that can not be explained in the Mac. Users running Mac OS X 10.6.8 or earlier must download version 4.22. For 64-bit Macs download version 4.23 Techtool Pro, A comprehensive application for checking for file system errors, I / O errors, POST errors, internal battery conditions, hard drive health (SMART), Bluetooth hardware, and network adapters. The cost of the application is $ 99, but it can provide far more details than the Apple Diagnostics Atomic, Dedicated RAM checker that can detect memory problems by using various memory test techniques. The cost of this application is $ 29.99, which can be detected in advance Monitor and maintain the health of the hard diskAs time goes on, almost all of the disks are likely to have smaller bugs. Since these errors may occur during normal computer use, the CD must be regularly monitored and maintained. Frequent errors can damage the file system, resulting in slowing down, crashing, or losing data. Fixing hard drives is usually more troublesome than troubleshooting steps; however, this is considered a precaution, taking into account the frequency of random discs, hard disk failure rates, and occasional irregularities. Monitor the health of the hard driveMost modern hard drives and SSDs have built-in sensors and supervisory circuits that form a system called SMART that means self-monitoring, analysis and reporting techniques. The purpose of this technology is to provide a report on the various specifications of the reliability of the drive, with the aim of finding an imminent hardware failure before it occurs. To check the SMART status of the drive, open the Disk tool, in Applications&gt; Tools, and then select the drive in the list on the left. If the selected drive supports SMART, you will see this message at the bottom of the window: S.M.A.R.T. Status: Verified. If you see the red letters about the failure, please back up the drive immediately, although it is hard to say how much data you will be able to back up. Even if the disk utility can solve the problem, you should also back up the data and replace the disk as soon as possible. If the Mac has a fused drive, or if FileVault is enabled, the disk utility may not show SMART status even if your hardware supports SMART. Open the system information, select the store in the list on the left, and then locate the SMART status on the right. Although the disk utility reports SMART status, but in fact you do not get an uninterrupted real-time drive reliability and its parameter reporting. There are many third-party utilities that monitor SMART status in detail and remind you of any changes. Smartmontools is a command-line utility consisting of two packages (s martctl and smartd). They use SMART to control and monitor the storage system and provide you with information on ongoing disk degradation through various statistics. Backblaze uses these reliability statistics to predict hard drive failures. SMART 5 - Redistribution industry number SMART 173- wear balance count SMART 187 - Reported error that could not be corrected SMART 197 - Number of sectors currently pending SMART 198 - Number of non-correctable sectors Download and install the latest package. Open the terminal and enter diskutil list. This command will populate all disks (either internal or external) with its size and identifier id. execute： 1Smartctl -a / dev / identifier id Replace the identifier ID with the drive ID. This command generates a long report of the drive. If the RAW value for any of the statistics is greater than zero, no investigation is required, although you may also see a list of values in percent. Any less than 60% of the need for your attention. You can also try these third-party utilities to provide you with more features and a good user interface. SMARTReporter is a SMART-based utility that also checks for I / O errors or RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks). It is priced at $ 5.99 on the Mac App Store SMARTUtility - This utility is also based on SMART. The SMART Utility not only displays individual attributes to view its status and information, but also uses an internal algorithm based on these attributes to detect a drive that failed before the SMART indication failed. Price $ 25 DriveDX - It provides a complete, extensive drive inspection and monitoring tool for Mac, the price is $ 20. It has an intuitive explanatory UI that can help you understand the meaning of each property. It also uses the drive health metrics that are most closely related to the drive failure to perform the overall drive health diagnostics Keep the hard drive healthyIn addition to regular monitoring, you also need to maintain the hard disk. There are many examples here After a power outage, the hard reboot and the system crash - especially the Mac exception Periodically, as part of a routine maintenance routine, identify any hidden directory corruption before becoming a problem Software-related errors may cause you to write corrupted data on your disk or worse, lost data Open the Disk Utility app. Select Start from the sidebar and click the “First Aid” button on the toolbar. When you click Run, the Disk Utility will verify the disc and try to repair it if necessary. If the Disk Utility finds any problems that need to be fixed, you will need to start your Mac from Recovery or Internet Recovery. Wait for the utility window to open, and then click the Disk tool.Select the boot disk, and then click First aid. In rare cases, the Disk Utility encounters a serious problem that can not be solved and you may need to use a third-party utility: DiskWarrior - a utility for preventing and resolving directory corruption, which is the main reason for Mac instability. DiskWarrior rebuilds the disk directory by using the data recovered from the original directory to resolve disk corruption, thereby recovering files and folders that you think are missing. Price $ 120. Techtool Pro - A comprehensive application for checking for file system errors, I / O errors, POST errors, internal battery conditions, hard drive health (SMART), Bluetooth hardware, and network adapters. The app is priced at $ 99, but can provide you with details that go far beyond Apple Diagnostics. ConclusionIn this part of this tutorial, we show how to maintain Macs by periodically performing Apple Diagnostics to check and hard disk authentication. Hard drives or solid-state drives are an important part of the Mac and OS operating systems. Although each hard drive will eventually be scrapped in a few years, you can keep your information and protect your data through regular backups and CD maintenance.","categories":[{"name":"Mac","slug":"Mac","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/categories/Mac/"},{"name":"Maintain","slug":"Mac/Maintain","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/categories/Mac/Maintain/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Mac","slug":"Mac","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/tags/Mac/"},{"name":"Efficiently","slug":"Efficiently","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/tags/Efficiently/"},{"name":"Maintain","slug":"Maintain","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/tags/Maintain/"}]},{"title":"MacOS window management","slug":"MacOS-window-management","date":"2017-07-24T14:53:00.000Z","updated":"2017-07-23T15:25:23.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/07/24/MacOS-window-management/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/2017/07/24/MacOS-window-management/","excerpt":"","text":"Window management class application is very much - well-known Moom, affordable simple Magnet, the main simulation of the Win system HyperDock, suitable for mouse dependents Window Tiny, Mosaic and so on. But I can not help but ask, when we discuss the window management, we are talking about what? In fact, the focus of the discussion should be on the use of window management habits and scenes, followed by App is the choice. But most people do not know their own habits at first, so this article from the use of personal habits, to provide a reference for everyone. My MacBook is connected to a large screen and then uses a USB keyboard with a Bluetooth mouse, so the touchpad is almost out of reach. MouseIf you often play FPS games you may understand the importance of the function keys outside the left mouse button. I use the Logitech M558 mouse, there are two function keys can greatly facilitate me to multi-window / multi-desktop switch. M558 mouse wheel is not only the middle mouse button, or a left and right toggle “joystick”, feel very good, very convenient to switch between the desktop. For ordinary users, the mouse can complete some keyboard inconvenience to complete the operation, such as file drag and drop, file selection, etc., these operations will most of the multi-window / desktop switching operation linkage. Therefore, the operation of these on the mouse for me is the most simple and convenient. Of course, with the function keys of the mouse not only M558, you can also buy your favorite mouse shape and brand. HyperDock - efficient window dynamic adjustment schemeHyperDock can achieve the following two functions: Window screen edge adaptive (similar to Win7 system screen edge layout function) Mouse drag window to adjust the window size Among them, the function can be said that I bought HyperDock the main reason, before entering the macOS, I used Ubuntu system, it native support Alt key mouse click on any part of the window to drag the window. I thought macOS is one of the UNIX-based systems, should also have such a function, but in the end still need to make up HyperDock. HyperDock also allows you to adjust the window size by dragging and dropping the mouse at any position in the window (only from the lower right corner, see the figure), reducing the precision of the operation requirements - you do not have to accurately aim the window edge and other indicators into a double arrow To adjust. Moom / Magnet - efficient window static layout schemeOver 70% of the case, I have to use the mouse function keys HyperDock to dynamically adjust the window. In addition to less than three percent, I will use the keyboard shortcuts to achieve efficient window static layout. Moom (or Magnet) can help me complete these less than 30% of the static layout operations: Full-screen browser (not ^ cover F that exclusive full screen) Browser writing App, PDF reading notes App, etc. - double App form of 1/2 split screen Quickly center a window at the edge of the screen Magnet can achieve HyperDock 1. Window screen edge adaptive function, but also support shortcut keys operation. But Magnet can only let the window up / down / left / right half screen, full screen, center. For ordinary users, Magnet can replace the following Moom, and if you do not need the mouse to drag and adjust the window, it can even replace HyperDock. Moom is the advanced version of Magnet, it can be divided into a × b (0 &lt;a, b &lt;26) block, and then customize the shortcut keys to fill the window to these blocks. For example, you can customize the shortcut keys to make the window 13/17 screen - is not the angle tricky? In short, Moom can meet many special needs. Moom can also customize the combination of multi-application window arrangement. For example, in the use of Ulysses writing, you may need to open Evernote to refer to the previously prepared outline, while in Safari search for the necessary information. You can set the three windows fixed mode set to Moom shortcut keys, when the three applications open at the same time, press the shortcut keys will be able to automatically arrange - very Professional, for me these functions are excess, but Moom There are still a lot of target users. The following is an example of a combination of Safari Evernote, in any case to adjust the size and location of the two application windows, can be a key to restore to the default size and location. Drag/Drop Way to adjust the windowWindow Tidy and Mosaic belong ‘Drag/Drop + Floating panel’form: When you drag the window, the faceplate appears in the screen, which contains many preset and custom permutations, and you can resize and position the window to one of them. The following is the Window Tidy operation demonstration. I am not accustomed to this operation: on the one hand, this operation requires a certain degree of operational accuracy - in the case of more expensive grid prone to misuse, and the window from the left to move to the right side of the floating panel , The efficiency is not improved; the other hand, the floating panel will block the screen part, like iOS 11 before the system volume panel as annoying.","categories":[{"name":"Mac","slug":"Mac","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/categories/Mac/"},{"name":"Window","slug":"Mac/Window","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/categories/Mac/Window/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Mac","slug":"Mac","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/tags/Mac/"},{"name":"Window","slug":"Window","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/tags/Window/"}]},{"title":"Want to catch the thieves who steal time, you need this Tomato clock: Tomates","slug":"Want-to-catch-the-thieves-who-steal-time-you-need-this-Tomato-clock-Tomates","date":"2017-07-19T13:25:00.000Z","updated":"2017-07-18T13:43:14.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/07/19/Want-to-catch-the-thieves-who-steal-time-you-need-this-Tomato-clock-Tomates/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/2017/07/19/Want-to-catch-the-thieves-who-steal-time-you-need-this-Tomato-clock-Tomates/","excerpt":"Open the App Store, find yourself into the focus of the application, there will be a variety of Tomato applications appear.

It can seize the time of the thief! Seize the “time thief” is the key to time managementTomato work method can be used effectively to assess the working status of the day, but one day down, I found myself on average to complete eight or so tomato time, that is effective working hours only 4 hours. But I feel that work is more than a moment, then the rest of the time where to go? Tomates’ Thiefs function can play a role in this scene. Thiefs is actually similar to RescueTime time tracking function. When you first allow the software to track your browser, Tomates will record the length of the application you’ve used on your Mac and the page you’re viewing. And those nonproductive software and web pages, such as YouTube, will be defined as “Thiefs”, of course, you can also customize a software or website for Thiefs. One day you can view your own records in chronological order, and Thiefs can be displayed separately. Without RescueTime so powerful and detailed analysis, Thiefs can only show the use of Mac on a linear record. But with my tomato time record, you can see in the end which applications or web pages, in the tomato time, the occupation of my time and energy. Then with the Focus interception software, Thiefs will be added to the intercept list, will be able to prevent them again “burglary” my time. Pay attention to the review and statistics of the Pomodoro applicationEvery morning when combing today’s to-do, I used to look at the previous day and last week’s tomato record, so come to estimate the number of tomatoes that can be done today. Tomato potatoes are only a list of tomato records in the form of a list, and Tomates has a special “review” window, elegant to the form of time axis to show, look at a lot of intuitive. And the calendar comes with a daily view of the calendar, the progress of today’s day there is a general estimate. And to the statistical interface, can provide more information and show the form. According to the classification of statistics, a week (month) trend, the time distribution of tomato pie pie, readily available. What are the scenarios for Tomates?Although both are used for the Pomodoro, Tomates and Tomato Potatoes have their own advantages and disadvantages, which determine their different use scenarios. Tomates combines time tracking, but it is weak on the combination with the to-do list. Although it is possible to add a completed item for the Pomodoro, there is no separate window, it is convenient to operate with tomato potatoes and can not add a label to the matter. In the latter part of the statistics, obviously the same project, such as the article “write outline” “complete draft” and “edit article”, was identified as a different task. While in the potato potatoes by adding one So if you look at its Thiefs function and do not have too many tedious things to use with the tomato work method every day, just need it for the Pomodoro function, then Tomates will sort out your time well.","categories":[{"name":"Mac","slug":"Mac","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/categories/Mac/"},{"name":"Time","slug":"Mac/Time","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/categories/Mac/Time/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Mac","slug":"Mac","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/tags/Mac/"},{"name":"Time","slug":"Time","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/tags/Time/"},{"name":"Record","slug":"Record","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/tags/Record/"}]},{"title":"SendAnywhere - Free full platform file sharing tool","slug":"SendAnywhere-Free-full-platform-file-sharing-tool","date":"2017-07-18T13:33:00.000Z","updated":"2017-07-18T13:30:50.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/07/18/SendAnywhere-Free-full-platform-file-sharing-tool/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/2017/07/18/SendAnywhere-Free-full-platform-file-sharing-tool/","excerpt":"I recently discovered this easy to use professional platform sharing tool: SendAnywhere.

Unfortunately, AirDroid only for the Android system services, Pushbullet need to log through the Google account, the transmission of large files worrying. Covering the entire platform of the clientFor a file transfer software, the supported platform is very important, directly affecting the number of devices available for use and transmission.Similar to other file transfer software, you need to install a client before you want to use SendAnywhere. And SendAnywhere coverage is very wide, can be regarded as a full platform. Mobile has a regular iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and even provides a Kindle version Desktop side is Windows (UWP and Win32 version), macOS, Linux version, also provides the Outlook plug-in. Web page has a web version, Chrome extension, Chrome app, Office 365 Outlook web page plugin, also opened the Wordpress plugin, Slack plugin, Gmail plugin, and provided to other browsers API. Key, two-dimensional, code link, share files everywhereSendAnywhere in terms of sharing can be said to be another way.There are three ways to share: “6-digit key”, “two-dimensional code sharing” and “sharing link”. Speed transmission and quick sharing, with data to speakAs the network conditions are different, I own the actual experience for everyone to make a reference. I use the 6-bit key to share the form, in the LAN environment from the iPhone to the PC directly to the transmission of 79 photos, a total of 151 MB, time-consuming 16 seconds. The average speed of 9.43 MB / s, with two-dimensional code to share the effect is the same. I use the 6-bit key to share the form, in the 4G environment from the iPhone to the PC to transmit 151 MB of photos, time-consuming 32 seconds, the average speed of 4.71 MB / s. This can also be seen as “through 6-bit key to share to friends” simulation test. I use the link to share the way, the same transmission 151 MB of photos. IPhone side upload takes 2 minutes and 45 seconds, the average speed of 0.92 MB / s. Received in the computer side of the file, download time 36 seconds, the average speed of 4.19 MB / s. This data depends on the upstream and downstream network speed, may be different. ) Through the results of this experiment summed up some of the experience, the dry goods posted for your reference: In the backup photo to the computer, the preferred use of 6-bit key form, the speed can reach the full speed of the network transmission. In a short time (10 minutes) to share with friends, it is recommended to choose 6 key transmission, the speed is quite fast. Depending on the slower side of the two sides. If the two sides of the network speed is not equal (one very slow), it is recommended to select the link to share. A short period of time the other party can not receive, then select the link to share, the file will be stored on the server for 48 hours. Beyond the sharing of local area network, regardless of network disk restrictionsThere are a lot of file transfer software is the limitations of “local area network”, file sharing software is usually limited (such as a single file size, video format, etc.), and these are precisely the advantages of SendAnywhere. The above mentioned several sharing operations are not limited to local area network. Again, not limited to local area network. With 6-bit key sharing, you can directly transfer between the two devices are not suitable for the existence of important files within the network disk. Use the link to share, it means that your friends can not download this software, you can directly open the link to download. Information age to share files, safety firstThe security of file transfers is also an important factor in our choice of transferring software, especially if the link sharing to the server needs to be compromised. File transfer using the 6-digit key transfers files directly between the two devices, and does not store files on the server. So you do not have to worry about file leaks. For link sharing and send to device, files are uploaded to the server temporarily. All files are encrypted and stored to protect against external attacks and spills. Stored files are automatically deleted from the server after expiration. At the time of transmission, the file is encrypted and transmitted so that the contents of the file being transferred can not be known by others. SummaryIn the file transfer and sharing, SendAnywhere only full platform and free client download files these two conscience function can go beyond many similar software. SendAnywhere provides the idea of sharing files, that is, through the network disk, directly transfer files between devices. The benefits of this are very obvious, we do not have to worry about the file was leaked, do not have to worry about the contents of the third party to see. Also due to network speed constraints, I do not think the current file transfer tool can completely replace the data lines, but excellent file transfer software can still save us a lot of time and the trouble of plugging data lines, especially in the backup photos, SendAnywhere Also provides the option to “back up all photos”, which is not lost to the data line experience.","categories":[{"name":"File","slug":"File","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/categories/File/"}],"tags":[{"name":"File","slug":"File","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/tags/File/"},{"name":"Share","slug":"Share","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/tags/Share/"}]}]}
